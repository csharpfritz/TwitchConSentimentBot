# Learning Twitch APIs and Integrations

## The Sentiment Analysis Chatbot

The simplest way to integrate with Twitch channels and chat is through an automated set of interactions in the chat room, typically called a chatbot.  In this module, you will create your first chatbot using either .NET Core 3 or JavaScript.

You will learn how to:

  + Authentication with Twitch servers
  + Identify public and private messages (called whispers) 
  + Send messages back to the chat room
  + Whisper messages to other chatters
  + Twitch API limits
