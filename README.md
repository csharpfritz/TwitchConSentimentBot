# TwitchCon SentimentBot

This is the source code and walkthrough for the construction of a chat bot, and a pair of extensions that provide sentiment analysis of the messages in a Twitch chat room.  This content was originally presented by [csharpfritz](https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz), [nodebotanist](https://twitch.tv//nodebotanist) and [fiercekittenz](https://twitch.tv/fiercekittenz) at TwitchCon NA 2019 in San Diego.
