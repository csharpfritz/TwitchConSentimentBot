# Get Started

In this warm-up session, you will:

 + Install the tools needed to be able to build and learn about Chat Bots and Twitch extensions
 + Explore the Twitch Developer Portal
 + Create your first Twitch Application

## Setup

We recommend you choose a rich code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to allow you flexibility in the languages and tools that you use, as well as the rich helper functionality to make you productive.  You are welcome to use any text editor to work with this content.

The code for the bot has been written and tested with [.NET Core 3](https://dot.net) and [Node 10.16](https://nodejs.org).

## Create your first Twitch Application

Twitch applications are applications identified by the Twitch platform that are granted access to be able to work with the APIs through the use of a ClientID and ClientSecret value.  To be able to register your application for integration with Twitch, you first need a Twitch ID.  Next, you need to register at https://dev.twitch.tv
